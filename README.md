# ElfAsm
Assembler for the 1802 processor

Goals:
Having never written an assembler before I have two phases for the goals I wish to meet the first phase should allow the most basic functionality. While the second phase will add significant quality of life improvements
Phase 1:
	1. Support all 1802 Nmemonics.
	2. Support lables.
	3. Support pseudo-Nmemonics (org, db, equ)
	4. Export Files as flat binaries, hex, and on/off listings for entry through switches
  
Phase 2:
	1. Support macros
	2. Support built time expresssion solving
	3. Support for other types of binaries?
